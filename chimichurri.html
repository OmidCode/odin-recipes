	<h1>Chimichurri Shrimp</h1>
  <div class="imgcontainer"><img src="images/shrimp.jpg" alt="Chimichurri Shrimp Dish"></div>
  <div class="container-description">
    <p class="description">This hearty dish is bursting with bold, zesty flavors thanks to the herbaceous mix of cilantro sauce, pickled jalapeño, and fresh lemon juice (a nod to classic Argentinian chimichurri) that we're drizzling over our shrimp, sautéed vegetables, and barley.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="ingredients">
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>10 oz Tail-On Shrimp (Peeled & Deveined)</li>
    <li>½ cup Pearled Barley</li>
    <li>¼ cup Cilantro Sauce</li>
    <li>1 oz Sliced Pickled Jalapeño Pepper</li>
    <li>4 oz Grape Tomatoes</li>
    <li>1 Tbsp Weeknight Hero Spice Blend (Onion Powder, Garlic Powder, Smoked Paprika & Whole Dried Parsley)</li>
    <li>2 Tbsps Dried Currants</li>
    <li>2 Scallions</li>
    <li>4 oz Sweet Peppers</li>
    <li>1 Lemon</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Fill a medium pot 3/4 of the way up with water; cover and heat to boiling on high. Once boiling, add the barley and cook, uncovered, 28 to 30 minutes, or until tender. Turn off the heat. Drain thoroughly and return to the pot.</li>
  <li>Meanwhile, wash and dry the fresh produce. Place the currants in a bowl; cover with hot water. Set aside to rehydrate at least 10 minutes. Cut off and discard the stems of the sweet peppers; remove the cores. Halve lengthwise, then medium dice. Thinly slice the scallions, separating the white bottoms and hollow green tops. Halve the tomatoes. Quarter and deseed the lemon. Roughly chop the jalapeño pepper. Thoroughly wash your hands immediately after handling.</li>
  <li>Pat the shrimp dry with paper towels (remove the tails if desired). Place in a bowl; season with salt, pepper, and enough of the spice blend to coat (you may have extra). Toss to coat. In a large pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat a drizzle of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the seasoned shrimp, diced sweet peppers, and sliced white bottoms of the scallions in an even layer; season with salt and pepper. Cook, without stirring, 2 to 3 minutes, or until browned and the shrimp are slightly opaque. Add the halved tomatoes; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, 1 to 2 minutes, or until the vegetables are softened and the shrimp are opaque and cooked through. Turn off the heat.</li>
  <li>Meanwhile, in a bowl, combine the cilantro sauce, the juice of 2 lemon wedges, and as much of the chopped jalapeño pepper as you’d like, depending on how spicy you’d like the dish to be. Taste, then season with salt and pepper if desired.</li>
  <li>To the pot of cooked barley, add the rehydrated currants (draining before adding) and 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Stir to combine. Taste, then season with salt and pepper if desired. Serve the finished barley topped with the cooked shrimp and vegetables and chimichurri. Garnish with the sliced green tops of the scallions. Serve the remaining lemon wedges on the side. Enjoy!</li>
