      <p class="description">Have you ever had pink sauce? Or better yet pink sauce pasta? It's the perfect combination of delicious, bold tomato sauce mixed with just a couple of key ingredients to make it decadent, creamy, and oh so dreamy. This recipe is inspired by Mama D's in Newport Beach, California. Anyone who's dined at Mama D's knows that despite their menu filled with dozens of delicious items including pizza, salad, oven-baked dishes, the pink sauce pasta with rigatoni is the best thing on the menu.</p>
