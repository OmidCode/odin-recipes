          <p class="description">This easy riff on the classic Korean barbecue dish adds noodles to soak up all the salty-sweet-umami-spicy flavors—a delicious way to celebrate Asian Heritage Month! Here, we sauté beef in savory-sweet bulgogi sauce infused with chili, lime, garlic, and soy. Next we add carrot, cabbage, and scallions. Taking it to next-level comfort food, we stir-fry it all with buttery ramen noodles, top it with a sprinkle of scallion greens and squeeze of lime juice, and 15 minutes later (that's right, 15!) this lightning-quick dinner idea is served!</p>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Wash and dry produce. Quarter lime. Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens.</li>
            <li> In a medium bowl, whisk together bulgogi sauce, soy sauce, chili sauce, garlic powder, and juice from half the lime (whole lime for 4 servings). Set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add beef* and season with salt (we used ½ tsp; 1 tsp for 4 servings) and pepper. Cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until browned and almost cooked through, 3-4 minutes. Add scallion whites, cabbage and carrot mix, and a pinch of salt and pepper to pan and cook, stirring frequently, until veggies are softened and beef is cooked through, 2-3 minutes more. Stir in half the bulgogi-soy mixture (you'll use the rest later). Remove pan from heat; cover to keep warm.</li>
            <li>Once water is boiling, add three-fourths of the noodles to pot (save the rest for another use). Cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, 1-2 minutes. Reserve ¼ cup noodle cooking water, then drain. Rinse noodles under cold water for 30 seconds. TIP: This stops the cooking and helps prevent sticky noodles.</li>
            <li>Return pan with beef mixture to low heat. Add drained noodles and 1 TBSP butter (2 TBSP for 4 servings); cook, stirring, until butter melts and noodles are evenly coated, 2 minutes. Add remaining bulgogi-soy mixture and toss until combined and noodles are warmed through. Taste and season with salt and pepper if desired. TIP: If needed, stir in reserved noodle cooking water, a splash at a time, until noodles are coated.</li>
            <li>Divide noodle stir-fry between bowls and top with scallion greens. Serve with remaining lime wedges on the side.</li>
